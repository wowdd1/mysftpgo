SFTPGo allows to securely share your files over SFTP, HTTP and optionally FTP/S and WebDAV as well.
Several storage backends are supported: local filesystem, encrypted local filesystem, S3 (compatible) Object Storage,
Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, other SFTP servers.

If this is your first installation please open the web administration panel:

http://localhost:8080/web/admin

and complete the initial setup.

The SFTP service is available, by default, on port 2022.

If the SFTPGo service does not start, make sure that TCP ports 2022 and 8080 are not used by other services
or change the SFTPGo configuration to suit your needs.
